        Netflix’s upcoming Devil May Cry anime, set to premiere on April 3, 2025, is produced by Adi Shankar (Castlevania) and animated by Studio Mir. The series follows a younger Dante, inspired by DMC3: Dante’s Awakening, with Johnny Yong Bosch voicing the lead.

A standout feature is the opening theme, "Rollin’" by Limp Bizkit, embracing a late '90s/early 2000s vibe. While anticipation is high, some fans have mixed reactions to character designs.
